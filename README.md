# Dice-Buster
Some people have claimed what they knew, but I don't fully think so.
There are many people playing , generally we all lose from these games. Because of personal concerns, I have some idea what if I knew how they built?
I just found a way, by applying tricks from the talk, we shall get good from it, hoping these people design a better pair of dice.
